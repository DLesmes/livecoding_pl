This video tutorial explains JavaScript variables using the analogy of labeled boxes for storing data.  It covers variable declaration (`let`), assignment (`=`), and the importance of descriptive variable names to improve code readability and maintainability for oneself and others.  The instructor emphasizes avoiding ambiguous names (e.g., "CDA" instead of "caja de Andy").  The video also differentiates between `let` (for variables whose values can change) and `const` (for constants with unchanging values), illustrating their use with examples in the code editor and console.  The tutorial encourages viewers to practice creating variables and share their examples in the comments.
